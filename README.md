# TimE BlockS Starter

This is a bare-bones starter web app using only HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. Open `index.html` in a browser to see the landing view and begin iterating on features.

## Structure

- `index.html` – basic document shell that wires the style sheet and script.
- `styles.css` – a minimal design system with a responsive layout and dark-mode support.
- `app.js` – placeholder logic that renders an empty state card and demonstrates DOM events.

## Next Steps

1. Replace the empty state with real components for your time-blocking workflow.
2. Add state management or connect to backend services as needed.
3. Consider integrating a build tool (Vite, Next.js, etc.) once requirements solidify.

Feel free to extend this starter however you like.
